# BeerJS: Reno

The sole purpose of BeerJS Reno is to find, grow, and strengthen the web community in our city... well, that and have a few beers of course. We welcome all people and JavaScript knowledge and mastery is not required to attend.

Come and hang out with engineers, developers, hobbyist, and people just interested in what we do.  Maybe you will make a friend or two.

## Want to hang out?

We will be meeting on the **2nd Thursday** of the month at *6pm*. The current home for all of our events will be [Rue Bourbon](https://www.ruebourbonreno.com/) in midtown Reno.  There is plenty of parking in the back.

## Why Github?

* Github is a more natural social network for a group of developers than Meetup.com.  
* Less spam
* Because Github is free which means more beer money (oh whiskey)!
